Initially, the restaurant managed rotations using a manual whiteboard system which proved to be challenging during peak hours. To provide a more optimized solution, my colleagues and I developed this React web app. At its core, the application leverages the capabilities of Firebase's Realtime Database to ensure that table rotation data is managed in real-time. This guarantees that the staff has an up-to-date view of table statuses, leading to improved customer service and streamlined operations. Furthermore, we incorporated Tailwind CSS to ensure the user interface is both intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. While the provided link showcases the demo, the actual implementation for the restaurant remains private, complete with its own secure login.",
